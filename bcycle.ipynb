    "BCycle’s mission is to [“offer a rider-centric bike sharing experience with products that work together to make moving around town as fun and convenient as possible.”](https://www.bcycle.com/) BCycle has made itself prominent in the Madison community by offering a fast, convenient way for students and commuters to get around town by using their electric bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "BCycles can be checked in and out from any of several docking stations around the city. Riders with a subscription can use the bike for 1.5 hours before having to re-rack the bike at a docking station. Upon re-racking, the rider can (a) be done with their ride, (b) check out a new bike, or (c) check out the same bike again. Failing to re-rack within 1.5 hours charges the rider with additional fees which, being poor graduate students, we seek to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces an interesting optimization problem. In this project, we seek to provide an optimal route for a client’s BCycle trip, stopping at various points of interest throughout the day. The client specifies a list of points of interest along with a score for each one of them, indicating how interested they are in visiting them. The client also specifies how much time they are willing to spend touring. Since the list of places may be long or they are far apart from each other, in general the client may not be able visit all of them in the given amount of time! We thus seek to provide them with a route that, in that limited amount of time, maximizes the scores of the places visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we develop routes for several points of interest that the client is interested in visiting, such as Union South, Engineering Hall, the Capitol, etc, as well as several BCycle stations along the way. In the final report, this data will be collected from online sources, but for now arbitrary points are chosen. Furthermore, we make some assumptions such as (a) the client is trying to avoid all fees, (b) the client does not want to re-visit a stop, (c) BCycles will always be available and charged at each docking station. We will review these assumptions with our client."

    "### Parameters of the Problem\n",
    "We have a set of $n$ places $\\{1,2,\\ldots, n\\}$ which is partitioned into BCycle docking stations (denote this set by $B$) and points of interest (denote this set by $P$). The user has specified scores $s_1,\\ldots, s_n$ for each of these places that quantify how exciting these places are to the user. Let the symmetric matrix $G \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ with $G_{i,j}$ being equal to the time it takes to go from place $i$ to place $j$. That is, we assume a fully connected graph where the time for each pair of places is given by $G_{i,j}$. Let $s \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots, n\\}$ denote the starting node, i.e., the place from which the tour will start and $f \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots, n\\}, f \\neq s$ be the final node, i.e., the place where the trip must end. The starting node will always be a docking station (in symbols we assume that $s \\in B$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $T$ be the time that the users' subscription allows them to use the bike (this is a constant, which as specified in the introduction will take the value of $90$ minutes). Let $t_{trip}$ denote the maximum duration that the tour can have (this is specified by the user). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Problem in Words\n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to formulate the following optimization problem: Find a valid tour (in the sense specified below) that maximizes the sum of the scores of the places included in the tour.\n",
    "\n",
    "By valid, we mean the following: \n",
    "* The tour starts from place $s$ and ends in place $f$. \n",
    "* The tour visits each place at most once.\n",
    "* The tour respects the time constraints:\n",
    "    + The total duration of the tour should be at most the one specified by the user (in our notation $t_{trip}$).\n",
    "    + Every time the tour visits a docking station, the available time on the BCycle is increased by $T=90$ minutes and it should never be allowed to become negative. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We formalize the above problem using precise notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Variables\n",
    "We start with the variables: We introduce a binary variable $x_{i,j} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for each pair of places $i,j \\in \\{1,\\ldots, n\\}$. We interpret the values as $1$ meaning that the solution tour traverses the edge $(i,j)$ and zero otherwise. We also introduce a variable $t_i$ for each place $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots, n\\}$. This is inteded to capture the time that each place is visited in the solution. We finally introduce the variables $bt_i$ for each place $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots, n\\}$ that intend to capture the remaining time on the BCycle when place $i$ is visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Objective Function\n",
    "For the objective function, we want to maximize the sum of all the scores for the visited places, that is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{x,t,bt}  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n  s_i x_{i,j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraint\n",
    "The first set of constraints say that the tour starts from the place $s$: The first constraint enforces that no edge that goes to $s$ is included in our solution, the second ensures that exactly one outgoing edge is taken, the fourth says that we start at time $t_s=0$ and the last says that we start with zero time remaining in the BCycle (note that the starting place $s$ will always be a docking station so this time will be instantly renewed to $90$ minitues).\n",
    "* $ \\sum_{j \\neq s} x_{j,s} = 0$.\n",
    "* $ \\sum_{j \\neq s} x_{s,j} = 1$.\n",
    "* $ t_s = 0$.\n",
    "* $ {bt}_s = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next set of constraints says that our solution should form a simple path:\n",
    "* $ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,k} = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{k,i}$ for all $k \\in  \\{1,\\ldots, n\\} \\setminus \\{s,f\\}$.\n",
    "* $ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{k,i} \\leq 1$ for all $k \\in  \\{1,\\ldots, n\\} \\setminus \\{s,f\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the diagonal of the matrix $(x_{i,j})$ to be zero, this means that visit nodes twice.\n",
    "* $x_{i,i} = 0$ for all $i \\in  \\{1,\\ldots, n\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints associated with the fact that the tour must end at place $f$ are the following (the first one says that we should definitely reach node $f$ and the second that we should not continue after reaching it):\n",
    "* $\\sum_{j \\neq f} x_{j,f} = 1$.\n",
    "* $\\sum_{j \\neq f} x_{f,j} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the time variables, if the edge $(j,i)$ is traversed, we want to make sure that the time $t_i$ is $t_j$ plus the amount of time $G_{j,i}$ needed to travel from node $j$ to node  $i$:\n",
    "* $t_i \\geq t_j + x_{j,i} G_{i,j} -   (1-x_{j,i})(n+1)\\max_{i,j}G_{i,j}$  for all $i \\neq s,j \\neq f$.\n",
    "The constraint just mentioned examines two cases: if $x_{i,j}=1$ (meaning that the edge is traversed), then  only the first term is active and the timestamp gets increased by the travel time, if on the other hand $x_{i,j}=0$ then only the second term is nonzero and it subtracts a quantity sufficiently large so that it makes the right hand side negative. Given that we already have the non-negativity constraint $t_i \\geq 0$, this means that in the second case we don't really impose anything additional.\n",
    "\n",
    "We similarly update the BCycle time variables:\n",
    "* ${bt}_i \\leq ({bt}_{j} - G_{j,i}) x_{j,i} \\mathbb{1}(j \\not\\in B) + (n+1)(T+max_{i,j}G_{ij})(1-x_{j,i}) + (T - G_{j,i})x_{j,i}\\mathbb{1}(j \\in  B)$ for all $i \\neq s,j \\neq f$.\n",
    "Again, the above  contains the following cases unified in a single constraint:\n",
    "* If the edge $(j,i)$ is selected and $j$ was not docking station, then the available time on the BCycle must be reduced by the travel time $G_{j,i}$.\n",
    "* If the edge $(j,i)$ is not selected, we add a large enough quantity that is guaranteed to make the right hand side positive, effectively causing the constraint to be vacuous.\n",
    "* If the edge $(j,i)$ is selected and $j$ was docking station, then the BCycle time gets renewed to $T=90$ mins and we subtract from this the travel time $G_{j,i}$.\n"
